# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
`.replace(/\[([^\]]*)\]/g, link + "$1</a>")`
(I just Googled it, I hope that's okay...)

# Teacher Feedback

I love that you are using google! The answer was actually a lot simpler, you just had to add the g flag to the end of the regex to make sure you got all instances of a pattern.
